

1. step one analyze the source code with SonarQube. sonar-scanner Configured in aws Ec2 instance along with GitHubActions SelfHosted runner
2. install the dependencies 
3. Scan (Analyze the dependencies ) with OWASP DependencyCheck which is Configured in aws Ec2 instance in GitHubActions SelfHosted runner
4. i want store OWASP dependencies check reports
5. build the Container Image (Docker enginer is setup in aws ec2 instance where SelfHosted runner working.)
6. i want to make proper image tagging. Semantic Versioning v1.0.3 with commit ID. i am using Argo Image updater, and Argo rollouts. Every image with tag should be maintaining in AWS ECR for better understanding and easy rollbacks. 
7. after tagging Container Image should be scan with Trivy (trivy is configured and setting up in AWS EC2 instance where SelfHosted runner is).
8. Publishing(Publishing) Final Image to AWS ECR 
9. delete the images because if all created images are kept into the server server storage will be increased.
